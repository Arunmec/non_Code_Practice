A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
Barking dogs seldom bite
if you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far go together
A spoon does not know the taste of soup, nor a learned fool the taste of wisdom
Change yourself and fortune will change
A teacher is better than two books
A journey of thousand miles begins with one step
