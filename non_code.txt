A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
Barking dogs seldom bite
if you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far go together
A spoon does not know the taste of soup, nor a learned fool the taste of wisdom
Change yourself and fortune will change
A teacher is better than two books
A journey of thousand miles begins with one step
A bad workman always blames his tool
Two wrongs do not make a right
Two most powerful warriors are patience and time
Dont expect things to go right the first time
When the going gets tough, the tough get going
If you are going through hell, keep going
Those who dare to fail miserablyu can achieve greatly
